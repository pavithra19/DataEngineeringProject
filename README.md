
# Azure Data Engineering Project

## Introduction
This project demonstrates various data engineering practices using Azure services. The main objective is to showcase how to build a scalable and efficient data pipeline using Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, and Azure Synapse Analytics. The motivation behind this project is to provide a comprehensive guide for data engineers to leverage Azure's capabilities for data processing and analytics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have an Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure account, you can create one [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

### Installation Process
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pavithra19/DataEngineeringProject.git
   cd DataEngineeringProject
   ```

2. **Set up Azure services:**
   ```bash
   Azure SQL Database
   Azure Data Lake Storage
   Azure Data Factory
   ```

3. **Import the ARM templates:**
   ```bash
   Import the ARM template code and Run the pipelines
   ```

### Software Dependencies
The project uses the following software and libraries:
- **Azure Data Factory:** For orchestrating data workflows.
- **Azure Data Lake Storage:** For storage account.
- **Azure SQL Database:** For Database.
- **Azure Databricks:** For scalable data processing and machine learning.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics:** For data warehousing and big data analytics.
- **Python:** For scripting and data manipulation.
- **Visual Studio Code:** For code editing and debugging.

### Latest Releases
Release notes and updates can be found in the [releases section](https://github.com/pavithra19/DataEngineeringProject/releases).

### API References
Refer to the following documentation for detailed API references:
- [Azure Data Factory REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/datafactory/)
- [Azure Databricks API](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/index.html)
- [Azure Synapse Analytics REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/synapse/)

## Build and Test

### Building the Project
1. **Deploy the Azure resources using the provided ARM templates:**
   ```bash
   az deployment group create --resource-group <your-resource-group> --template-file azuredeploy.json
   ```

2. **Configure your Azure services by editing the `config.json` file with your Azure resource details.**

### Running Tests
Run CI/CD pipelines at the **Azure DevOps Git** to ensure the data pipeline works end-to-end.
